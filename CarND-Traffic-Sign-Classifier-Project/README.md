## Data Set Summary & Exploration 

### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the numpy library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic signs data set:
The size of training set is 34799
The size of the validation set is 4410
The size of test set is 12630
The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is a histogram of classes/labels of training, validation and test set.
